The objectives for the city-to-city peer review tool are to:

1.	To design a practical city-to-city peer review tool for measuring city resilience and action planning
2.	To apply the peer review tool to 3 EU member states to support disaster risk reduction (DRR) in those cities as well as refine the tool to enable it to be applicable to other cities
3.	To develop and apply an impact evaluation methodology to evaluate the peer review tool and gauge its impact on enhancing city resilience
4.	To disseminate the peer review tool and impact evaluation methodology to ensure wide take-up

The peer review tool developed through Uscore2 will be piloted in Viggiano, Salford and Amadora. These three cities have different disaster risk profiles; geographical and demographic characteristics; and statutory and regulatory frameworks. All are role models within the Making Cities Resilient Campaign. The effectiveness of the peer review tool will be evaluated using a methodology developed by the University of Manchester. The tool will be aligned to the indicators for the Sendai Framework and UNISDR MCR enabling on-going assessment of its applicability in reporting local progress against the Sendai Framework.
