  I wish to be fully engaged in developing environmental sustainability and
  territorial safety in the urban and land-use government actions. To this aim,
  our community will actively participate with the Province of Potenza in the
  action proposed for strengthening territorial resilience by adopting local
  policies and specific actions.
