The Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction is a biennial multi-stakeholder forum established by the UN General Assembly to review progress, share knowledge and discuss the latest developments and trends in reducing disaster risk.

The Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction is a critical component of the monitoring and implementation process of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030). The outcomes of the Global Platform inform the deliberations of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and the UN 2019 Climate Summit from a disaster risk reduction perspective.  These efforts contribute towards the successful achievement of a risk-informed 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development.

Over the past decade, the Global Platform has assumed the role of assessing and reviewing the progress in the implementation of the global disaster risk reduction agenda, and to serve as a platform for governments and stakeholders to share good practices, identify gaps and to make recommendations to further accelerate the implementation. In total, five sessions of the Global Platform have taken place since 2007. While each of the sessions focused on specific themes, the following topics have been recurrent in most of the sessions, in different forms and reiterations: 1) national and local implementation, 2) investments & economics of disaster risk reduction, and 3) linkages and coherence with climate change and sustainable development.

The fifth session of the Global Platform (GP2017), held in Cancun, Mexico, was the first to take place after the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, and it reaffirmed that full implementation of the Sendai Framework will reinforce the achievement of other international agendas. It also reconfirmed the Global Platform as a fundamental mechanism to foster practical coherence in implementation of disaster risk reduction with other international agendas, in particular the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Agreement on climate change and the New Urban Agenda The outcomes of the Global Platform are also relevant for humanitarian assistance, as reducing disaster risk can also contribute to preventing and reducing humanitarian crises, and as the Agenda for Humanity calls for the anticipation of disaster and crises and for addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. The multi-stakeholder nature of the Global Platform has been acknowledged as a critical driver for fruitful deliberations, and for the effective implementation of the Sendai Framework.

The participation of representatives from a wide range of sectors of governments and stakeholder groups reflects the shift – enshrined in the Sendai Framework – from managing disasters to managing disaster risk. It is now acknowledged that reducing disaster risk is a shared responsibility which concerns everyone – from citizens to high-level political leaders, government institutions, private sector, civil society and scientific and technical institutions.
