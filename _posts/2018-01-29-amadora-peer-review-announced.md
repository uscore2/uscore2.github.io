title: 'Date Confirmed: Amadora Peer Review Announced'
---
Following the Viggiano peer review in October 2017 and subsequent Salford workshop in November 2017, which have allowed for refinement of the Uscore2 city-to-city peer review methodology, the project team are now pleased to announce that the Amadora peer review will take place between the 18th and 20th of April 2018.

The Portuguese city will play host to an international team of experts from Viggiano, Italy who will be supported by experts from Salford, United Kingdom to make up the Review Team. Members of the Review Team have yet to be selected, but will be experts in the modules that Amadora have chosen to be reviewed on:

- Module 1 - Disaster Risk Governance
- Module 6 - Strengthen Institutional Capacity for Resilience

Over the course of the 3-day peer review, members of the Review Team will gather information from sources such as Amadoraâ€™s local government, emergency services, community groups and other stakeholders. Information will be gathered through an initial exchange of relevant documents prior to the peer review as well as presentations, interviews and focus groups during the event itself.

Following the peer review, Amadora will be presented with a report highlighting the findings of the peer review. The Uscore2 process will be critiqued once more and go through a further process of refinement ahead of the Salford peer review which will take place before the end of July 2018.
