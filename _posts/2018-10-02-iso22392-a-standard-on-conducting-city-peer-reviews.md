ISO22392 a standard on conducting city peer reviews

A new standard on conducting city peer reviews for disaster risk reduction (DRR) was discussed today at the General Assembly of the International Standards Organisation in Geneva, Switzerland. The standard, ISO22392 “Conducting peer reviews for disaster risk reduction”, will bring together international experiences of conducting peer reviews for DRR across a number of countries to provide guidelines on how cities can benefit, organise and evaluate a peer review.

ISO22392 was discussed within a session of how international standards can support global efforts to deliver Sustainable Development Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities. The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly.

Professor Duncan Shaw, moderator of the session and project leader for ISO22392 said “A peer review is a privileged opportunity for a host to reflect on their activities with a team of independent experts. Through conversation, exchanging best practice, and examining performance, mutual learning can be enhanced to identify potential improvements and existing best practices. From this, the host and the reviewers can learn.”

“The standard will draw on the work of the UScore2 project as well as other international peer reviews to present an easy to use methodology for cities to run a peer review of their own DRR practices.”

Over 800 people attended the ISO General Assembly, representing their national standards bodies, government, NGOs, industry and academia.

Note: The UScore2 consortium involves the cities of Salford, Amadora and Viggiano, the University of Manchester, UNISDR, the UK Department of Communities and Local Government, the Portuguese National Authority of Civil Protection and the Associazione di Protezione Civile Gruppo Lucano.
