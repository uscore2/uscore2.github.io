---

It has now been confirmed that the Uscore2 Greater Manchester (Salford) Peer Review will take place 9th-11th July 2018.

Salford will host the expert review team from Amadora, Portugal who will have local and national representatives as part of their delegation.

The review will be undertaken on the following Uscore2 modules:

1. Module 8a: Increase Infrastructure Resilience
2. Module 10: Recovery

The panel of expert reviewers will have the opportunity to study key Greater Manchester resilience documents in advance of the peer review visit.

Site visits will play a key part of demonstrating the resilience of utility services in the region. Central to the review will be the opportunity to meet stakeholders who will give short presentations on their respective area and give the chance for the panel to ask questions of them in order to gain knowledge of how resilience plays a key part of Greater Manchester's structure.

Following the review a report will be produced by the Portuguese panel identifying areas of good practice and recommendations.
