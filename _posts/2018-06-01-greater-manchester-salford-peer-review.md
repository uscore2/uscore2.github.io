---

It has now been confirmed that the Uscore2 Greater Manchester (Salford) Peer Review will take place 9th-11th July 2018.

Salford will host a peer review team from Amadora, Portugal which will consist of DRR experts.

The review will be undertaken on the following Uscore2 modules:

1. Module 8a: Increase Infrastructure Resilience
2. Module 10: Recovery

Pre-visit information has been provided to the panel of expert reviewers which will provide them opportunity to study key Greater Manchester resilience documents in advance of the peer review visit.

Site visits will play a key part of demonstrating the resilience of utility services in the region. Central to the review will be the opportunity to meet local stakeholders who will be presenting information regarding their respective areas of responsibility and provide the opportunity for the panel to ask the stakeholders questions in order to gain an understanding of how resilience plays a key part in Greater Manchester's structure.

Following the review a report will be produced by the Portuguese panel identifying areas of good practice and recommendations.
