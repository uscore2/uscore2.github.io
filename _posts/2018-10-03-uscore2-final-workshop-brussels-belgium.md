The Uscore2 project final workshop took place on the 27th and 28th September 2018 in Brussels, Belgium. With the United Nations hosting the event, the international team travelled to the city to work their way through a busy agenda aimed at finalising the city-to-city peer review methodology ahead of dissemination at the Masterclass events in November.

Day One

Objectives of the final workshop were outlined and the team reviewed the project deliverables ahead of Viggiano, Amadora and Salford discussing their experience of being the subject of a peer review under the Uscore2 methodology. The University of Manchester reviewed how the IEM developed and findings from implementing the IEM in the 3 Peer Reviews. The UNISDR and a representative from DG-ECHO reflected on how the experience from the Uscore2 project compares to national level DRR peer reviews and identified recommendations. A table top exercise was also carried out to put under the microscope one of the module that hadnâ€™t been tested as part of the Viggiano, Amadora and Salford peer reviews.

Day Two

Day Two picked up where Day One left off by continuing with table top exercises on the remaining modules. Discussion centred on the final amendments required by the city-to-city peer review tool and the impact evaluation methodology for DRR. Rounding up Day Two was planning for the Masterclasses that will be held in Barcelona and Rome during the month of November as well as exploration of the final report content.
