The second International Conference on Risks, Security and Citizenship took place on the 28 and 29 of March 2019 in Setúbal, Portugal. The theme of the conference was “Risk Management and Climate Change”. The purpose of the conference was to acknowledge that climate change is now widely recognised as one of the most prominent risks and challenges faced by humanity.

“We now find signs the climate is changing. The effects of climate change are several and have repercussions in the social, economic and environmental framework.

With this event, we pretend to reflect on the problematic of risk in the context of the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 at the local level, in coherence with the three pillars of the international agenda: International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction, Objectives of Sustainable Development and the Action Plan for Climate Action.

In this thought we develop a thematic multidisciplinary program for knowledge sharing and the application of methodologies regarding the reduction of Disaster Risk, as well has the safeguard of the security of citizens and their communities.” (http://www.smpcb.pt/icrsc2019/en/apresentacao.htm)

On day 1 of the conference the Uscore2 Project Manager, Jon Percival, delivered a presentation on the Uscore2 city-to-city peer review methodology at the Fórum Municipal Luísa Todi. The presentation covered the collaborative approach to the development of the methodology that included international partner cities from Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom as well as UNISDR, an academic body and government agencies. Central to the presentation was the practical application of the methodology which was piloted in Viggiano (Italy), Amadora (Portugal) and Salford (United Kingdom). The experience of using the methodology in cities with differing scales and risk profiles was instrumental in shaping the development of the Uscore2 approach.
