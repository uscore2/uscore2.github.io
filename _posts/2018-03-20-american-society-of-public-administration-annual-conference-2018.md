title: American Society of Public Administration Annual Conference 2018
---
The American Society of Public Administration (ASPA) held their annual conference in Denver from 9th March to 13th March 2018. ASPA brings together almost 1,300 practitioners, scholars and students to join theory with practice and share current trends and information in public administration with each other. 

This year, the theme for ASPA's conference was 'Mission Focused and Service First: Creating Innovative Solutions'. This aligns with Uscore2 which is using innovative techniques such as peer reviews to support local governments in building city resilience and developing disaster risk reduction strategies. 

In one of the sessions focusing on disaster management, The University of Manchester presented the results of the systematic literature review undertaken as part of the Uscore2 project with a view to sharing knowledge gained during this process and inviting comment from other global perspectives. 

Attending the conference provided useful insights into the challenges faced by governments and public administrators in managing disasters. Additionally it supports the collaborative nature of Uscore2 which promotes building partnerships and interdisciplinary approaches to learning as a means to improve city resilience.
