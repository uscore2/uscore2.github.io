title: Uscore2 Greater Manchester (Salford) Peer Review
---

July 9-11th saw Salford welcome the Amadora peer review team to Greater Manchester. The 3 day event brought the panel of Portuguese experts to the city region to review two of the Uscore2 methodology modules:

E8a Module - Increase Infrastructure Resilience
E10 Module – Recovery

Day 1 of the review brought together representatives of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA CCRU) Civil Contingencies and Resilience Unit, ARUP, Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), Ministry of Defence and KCOM to present on subjects such as Greater Manchester risk and governance, infrastructure resilience, national and civil protection governance and the UK approach to protecting critical infrastructure, military support to protecting infrastructure and telecoms resilience. Following each of the presentations the panel had the opportunity to gain further insight through question and answer sessions. Following the formal sessions the review team visited the offices of Transport for Greater Manchester to discuss transport network resilience and visit the TfGM Control Room.

Day 2 took place at the Highways England Milnrow depot where civil engineering and highways experts presented on the resilience of the strategic road network followed by utility resilience presentations and site visits from Electricity Northwest and United Utilities.

Day 3, the final day, was hosted at The University of Salford’s THINKlab where Councillor Antrobus shared his views on resilience while MHCLG discussed UK national recovery arrangements. AGMA CCRU covered the Greater Manchester approach to recovery while representatives of the GMCA covered the Greater Manchester Resilience Forum. Salford City Council discussed the recovery from the flooding event of 2015 and the Environment Agency covered their approach to post incident recovery which was further enhanced by a guided visit to the second Salford flood basin. The focus group session with the Environment Agency, Urban Vision and Salford City Council covered protective infrastructure and the build back better approach which has been adopted.

Following the conclusion of the peer review the Portuguese review team returned home and will begin to prepare a report for Greater Manchester (Salford) taking into consideration the information that they were presented with during their visit. This will help to build a picture of Greater Manchester’s resilience and the Amadora team will identify areas of good practice and recommendations. With the assistance of The University of Manchester the review team will also carry out an impact evaluation. 

The Uscore2 team are grateful to all participants who attended the event and assisted with its facilitation.
