title: Impact Evaluation Methodology
---

Using data collected through interviews and observations with Uscore2 partners before, and after the pilot peer review in Viggiano, an impact evaluation methodology was designed.

The aim of the impact evaluation methodology is to support host cities in assessing the strengths and weakness of the peer review process and its resulting outcomes. Impact evaluations provide important information regarding how cities can further develop their disaster risk reduction (DRR) and city resilience strategies; recommendations to develop these strategies, and the overall impact of the peer review for the city.

The interview questions and observations guides used to develop the impact evaluation were designed using findings from the systematic literature review published on 26th September 2017. The data collected as a result of these processes has offered some benchmarks for expected impacts as result of the project. Additionally, insights from the observations have revealed a number of interesting issues which will help to inform the development of the impact evaluation methodology, and the development of the peer review tool.

The review by partners will support revisions and developments of the impact evaluation methodology for use in future peer reviews. The methodology will also be facilitated by further interviews with those involved in the pilot peer review, and the recommendations developed as the result of evaluating the application of the peer review tool to Viggiano.
