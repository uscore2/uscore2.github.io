title: Draft Modules Circulated to IAB for Review
---
The Uscore2 peer review methodology will take a modular approach based upon UNISDR's Ten Essentials for Making Cities Resilient campaign. Uscore2 modules have been designed to support the themes identified within the Ten Essentials, but also breakdown some of the areas which cities undertaking a peer review may wish to explore in greater depth. All modules exist in varying states of draft format, but those most developed were circulated yesterday to the project's International Advisory Board for feedback.

The Ten Essentials provides an operational guide for the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction which is a voluntary, 15-year, non-binding agreement that recognises the primary role of the State in reducing disaster risk, but also that responsibility should also be shared amongst other stakeholders such as local government and the private sector, amongst others.

The aim of the Sendai Framework is:

"The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries."

By aligning with the Ten Essentials the Uscore2 project has taken a position whereby it can build upon an internationally recognised disaster resilience framework within a peer review format that can be applied between cities from different nations.

The International Advisory Board is made up of disaster resilience professionals from Belgium, Finland, France, Iceland, South Africa and Sweden who will review the progress of the Uscore2 project to date and help to shape further advances from the perspective of different nations.
