Amadora Workshop 8th-9th June 2017

On Thursday the 8th and Friday the 9th of June 2017 UScore2 Project partners met together for the first time at the Kick Off Workshop in Amadora, Portugal.

Hosted by Amadora’s Civil Protection team the workshop brought partners together to hear presentations from the array of organisations from across Europe who make up the project team.

Day one of the workshop saw presentations from Amadora, Viggiano and Salford where the peer review methodology will be tested and the United Nations discussed the relationship between peer review and the implementation of the Sendai Framework. The University of Manchester presented the literature review findings and Salford covered the rationale of the peer review methodology as well as covering the modules that have been completed to date. Partners reviewed the modules and provided feedback, shaping them and bringing new perspectives. Day one of the workshop culminated in the exploration of regional / national perspectives with presentations from Portugal’s Protecao Civil Autoridade Nacional (ANPC) and Italy’s Protezione Civile "Gruppo Lucano".

The second day brought a summary of module feedback obtained from the first day of the workshop as well as the ANPC presenting their findings from experience of carrying out a peer review at a national level in Malta. Throughout late morning and into the afternoon energy was focussed on exploring how modules could be developed further as well as establishing which teams will take responsibility for drafting the remaining modules.

Bringing the second day of the Amadora workshop to a close was a presentation of community artwork to key organisations involved in a local resilience project and finally an outstanding demonstration of first aid skills by youth volunteers from the Red Cross.

The UScore2 team left the workshop with an excellent awareness of progress to date and a keen focus on next steps.
