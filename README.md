## The Uscore2 project

The Uscore2 project aims to design and test a generic, practical, city-to-city, disaster risk reduction peer review tool for cities across EU member states and beyond via the UNISDR Making Cities Resilient campaign (MCR).

The project will involve collaborative work between the municipalities of Salford, Amadora and Viggiano. the University of Manchester, UNISDR, the Department of Communities and Local Government (UK), Portuguese National Authority of Civil Protection and the Associazione di Protezione Civile Gruppo Lucano.
